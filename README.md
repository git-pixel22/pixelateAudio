# pixelateAudio

This little thing was build because one day I just wanted to send a voice note to a person without revealing my actual voice.

If the application is not available on cloud or the link has expired, then you can run this on your local machine.

Just clone the repo

```
git clone <link>
```

then simply move into project directory if using terminal by doing

```
cd pixelateaudio
```

Now install the requirements by doing

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now run the program by
```
flask run
```

Open your browser and go to your localhost's port 5000.

And there you have it.
